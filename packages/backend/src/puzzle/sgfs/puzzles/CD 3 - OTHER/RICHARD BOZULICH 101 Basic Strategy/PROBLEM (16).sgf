(;W[qk];B[jq]C[CORRECT Black should turn, forcing White to block. Blak now captures the lone white stone, and White has to make shape. Black now has sente to take the big point at the bottom, neutralizing the influence of White's corner enclosure.])
(;W[fp];B[dn];W[jq];B[qk]
(;W[qj];B[pk]C[CORRECT If White fails to make shape, as in the correct answer, Black will peep and extend. The five white stones are under attack.])
(;W[pl];B[pk];W[ok];B[ql];W[pm];B[oj];W[nk]C[CORRECT White could answer Black with the shoulder hit, making a moyo. but his four stones are almost dead and his territory on the bottom right has almost disappeared. Black has sente to deal with White's moyo.])
(;W[pk];B[pl];W[ql];B[qm];W[rl];B[ok];W[pj];B[om]C[CORRECT If White attaches, Black can make sabaki. White's territory in the lower right again has almost disappeared and he has no prospects of making a moyo at the bottom.])))
(;B[rg];W[fp];B[dn];W[jq];B[ri];W[qk]C[If Black simply captures the white stone, White will approach. If Black now tries the move in correct answer, White will jump. White has managed to take the big points at the bottom, preserved his territory and stones on the right side, and has good prospects for building a moyo in the lower right part of the board.]))
