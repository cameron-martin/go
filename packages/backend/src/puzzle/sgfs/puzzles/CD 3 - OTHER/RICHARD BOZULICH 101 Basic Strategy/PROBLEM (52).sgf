(;B[hp];W[kq];B[kp];W[jp];B[iq]LB[lp:A]C[CORRECT Black should play the knight's move. If White tries to make sabaki by attaching, Black simply hanes and draws back. White is unable to capture with A because the ladder favors Black. White has not been able to make sabaki\: His stones are split and under attack.])
