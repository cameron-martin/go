(;W[qf];B[nj]C[CORRECT White secures the corner when he cuts wit the marked stone, so Black should switch to the outside and attach. After White prevents the cut making himself overconcentrated, Black makes good shape and thickness in the center.])

(;W[qf];B[rg];W[pe];B[og];W[pf];B[ri]C[CORRECT White shouldn't play elsewhere, or his bad aji lets Black make profit in the upper right capturing the two stones after forcing White.])

(;W[pg];B[oh];W[og];B[nh]C[CORRECT White might also extend, and the following sequence seems natural. Black builds thickness while White's stones are being overconcentrated.])
