(;W[fk];B[fj];W[ek];B[dk];W[el];B[dl];W[dm];B[em];W[fm];B[ej];W[fl];B[cl]C[CORRECT Black should defend against the cut lightly with the shoulder hit. If White cuts, Black can make a squeeze and form a thick position. Most of White's territory has been taken away from the lower left.])
(;W[cj];B[di];W[hk];B[ci]C[CORRECT If White pushes once, Black can extend. Now White must make a turn in the center, so Black can turn on the left side establishing a position on the left side. If White didn't turn in the center, Black would build a thick wall facing the upper part of the board while attacking White's group on the lower side.]))
(;B[fk];W[de]C[Connecting is not good. Black's stones are heavy and after Black anwers White's approach, White can decide how to attack the heavy Black group.]))
