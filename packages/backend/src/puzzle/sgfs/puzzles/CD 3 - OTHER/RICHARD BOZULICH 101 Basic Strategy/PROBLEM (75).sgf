[rh:B]C[CORRECT Black should sacrifice the three stones above. While Black makes shape, he is also threatening to capture with A, so White must capture with B. Black now has sente to make a gigantic moyo.])

;B[ik]C[CORRECT Invading Black's moyo becomes urgent. Black is happy to confine White to the corner in sente. Black first makes a threat at top right forcing White to connect. Black can map out a huge moyo again with his sente.]))
