(;B[mq];W[nl];B[oj];W[nk];B[pj]C[CORRECT It is urgent for Black to secure the bottom by extending. White pushes up but Black becomes thick on the right, and his position at the bottom is stable. White has also become thick, but he has played on points of no value and is still without eyes.])

LB[qf:A][jc:B]C[Turning is certainly a big point that influences the center, but White will atatck the corner. Black must live, and White gets to secure his position at the bottom. White can now play at A or B.]))
