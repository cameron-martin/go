;W[qi]C[CORRECT Although it's bad shape, the empty triangle is the only move for saving the two black stones. White must save his three stones by making a shoulder hit on the right. Black then makes two forcing moves at the top, and switch to the right to peep. White defends, and Black takes up a position on the right side.])
