;B[eq]
C[... let Black attach with 2. ]
;W[er];B[dp];W[cr];B[fq];W[fr]
C[White will secure her stones in the lower left corner with the sequence to 7. ]
;B[gq]
C[Black makes a thick position on the outside with 8, but ... ]
;W[mn]
C[... this thickness is neutralised when White jumps to 9. <= ]

C[Failure.  

With the marked black stone in place, playing the joseki with White 1 is not very efficient. ]

LB[cf:A]
C[Black can now seize the initiative on the left side with an approach move at 2 or A. You should never blindly follow a joseki without looking at the whole board. <= ]
