C[Problem 91. Black to play.  

White has just made a wide extension from her thickness above with the marked stone. Where should Black play next ? ]

C[Correct Answer.  

Black 1 is a strong move because it expands Black's moyo at the top and threatens to force at A. Instead of playing the marked stone, White should have turned at 1. <= ]

C[Failure.  

Responding to the marked stone by extending to 1 is not good. ]

C[White turns at 2. If White played the marked stone at 2, Black would extend to A, neutralising White's thickness above. <= ]
