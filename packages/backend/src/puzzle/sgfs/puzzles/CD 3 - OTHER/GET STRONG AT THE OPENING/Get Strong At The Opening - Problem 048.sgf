C[Problem 48. White to play.  

This time White has made a high approach with 1. Instead of the diagonal move at A, Black plays the joseki to 6. How should White continue ? ]

C[Correct Answer.  

White should pincer the black stone in the upper right corner with 1. ]

C[If Black plays 2, ... ]

C[... White will jump to 3 and make a moyo on the right side. Black's stones are still under attack, so White will end in sente. <= ]

C[Failure.  

Playing the joseki move of White 1 is not good. ]

LB[ql:A]
C[Black can settle his stones in the upper right corner by extending to 2 and threaten to invade White's position at the bottom with a move at A. (See Problems 30, 33, 36, 39, and 42 in Get Strong at Invading.) <= ]
