C[Problem 14. Black to play.  

In this sanren-sei opening, Black makes a high two-space pincer with 2. The joseki to White 7 follows. Where should Black play next ? ]

C[Failure.  

Clearly, Black 1 is a good point locally, but ... ]

LB[ph:B][pn:A][fq:1]
C[... White will take the vital point of 2, and Black's stone at the top is drifting in the shadow of White's influence. For the same reason, Black 1 at A is also bad. After 2, White can aim at the invasion at B. <= ]
