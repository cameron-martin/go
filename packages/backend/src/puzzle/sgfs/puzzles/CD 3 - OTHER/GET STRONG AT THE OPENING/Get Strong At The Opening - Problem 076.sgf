C[Problem 76. White to play.  

What should White do ? Should she make a corner enclosure or should she take a big point ? ]

TE[2]
C[Correct Answer.  

Taking the big point of White 1 is the only move. White not only makes an extension from her three stones below, but she also limits how far Black can extend from his corner enclosure above. ]
;B[ce]
C[If Black makes an approach move at 2, ... ]
;W[qf]
C[... White extends all the way to 3, threatening Black's corner enclosure.  <= ]

C[Failure.  

Making a corner enclosure with 1 is out of the question. ]
;B[qj]
C[Black 2 becomes too good a move. It is an ideal extension from his corner enclosure above and it makes the three white stones below thin. ]
;W[ql]
C[If White strengthens them by extending to 3, ... ]
;B[oj]
C[... Black jumps to 4, expanding his moyo on the upper right side. <= ]
