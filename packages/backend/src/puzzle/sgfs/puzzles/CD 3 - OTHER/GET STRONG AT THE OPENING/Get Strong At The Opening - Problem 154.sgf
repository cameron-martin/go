C[Problem 154. Black to play.  

A sharp encounter has taken place in the upper right. Black's stones are out in the center and he would like to play a big extension on the left. Should Black so this immediately or should he make another move on the right ? ]

Black 1 is the most urgent point. This move makes Black's stones in the upper right absolutely safe and it also takes away space for White to make her own stones safe. ]
