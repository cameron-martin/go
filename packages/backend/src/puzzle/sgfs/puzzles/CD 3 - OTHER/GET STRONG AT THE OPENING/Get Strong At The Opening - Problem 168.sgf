C[Problem 168. White to play.  

This is another after-the-fuseki problem. Where is the vital point for White to play ? ]
(;W[hk]

C[Correct Answer.  

The knight's move of White 1 is the vital point. With this move, White builds a moyo in the center and Black is now unable to use his thick wall above to attack White. ]

C[Failure.  

Although White 1 is often a good move, in this case it is too small in scale. ]
;B[gk];W[ii];B[ik];W[ki];B[kk]
C[Black advances into White's sphere of influence with the sequence to 6 while using his thickness to maintain the pressure on White. <= ]
