C[Problem 33. Black to play.  

This time Black encounters White's mukai-komoku formation (the marked stones) with a high approach move at 1. After exchanging 3 for 4, what should Black do ? ]

C[It would be natural for White to cut at 2, but ... ]

C[... then 3 would give Black wonderful influence in the center which combines well with his niren-sei formation on the right. <= ]

C[Variation.  

White could also attach at 2. ]

C[The sequence to White 8 would then be the natural flow. ]

C[However, Black 9 becomes an excellent move, making an ideal extension from his stones at the top and the bottom. ]

C[White would then play 10 on the right side. ]

C[The sequence to 18 is from a game between Takagawa (Black) and Sakata. <= ]
