C[Problem 23. White to play.  

There is a proverb which says 'Only a fool neglects to connect against a peep.' But what about in this case ? Should White connect against the peep of Black 1 or is there something else she should do ? ]

C[Correct Answer.  

Connecting at A is certainly an important move, but before doing so, White should play 1 ... ]

C[... and 3, ... ]
;B[qj];W[pm]
C[... then connect at 5. In this way, White creates a base for her stones and  Black's subsequent attack against them will not be so severe. <= ]

C[Failure.  

Blindly following the proverb by connecting at 1 is bad. ]
;B[rl]
C[Black plays 2 and White's stones are rootless, so they will have to run away into the center. <= ]
