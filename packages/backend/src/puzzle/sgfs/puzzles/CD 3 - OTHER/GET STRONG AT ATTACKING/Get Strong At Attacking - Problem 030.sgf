C[Problem 30. Black to play.  

Black's position in the upper right is thick, while White's stones at the top are thin. How should Black attack ? ]

C[Correct Answer.  

Black 1 is the vital point in this position. Next ... ]

C[Pushing up with 2 is only natural, but ... ]

C[... Black blocks with 3, ... ]

C[... forcing White to turn with 4. ]

C[Next, Black peeps with 5 and ... ]
;W[mc]
TR[fc]
C[... White's stones are left heavy and separated from the marked one on the left. White is in trouble. See Problem 136 for the continuation. <= ]

C[Variation.  

If White attaches at 4, ... ]
;B[le]
C[... Black will wedge in at 5. ]

C[The sequence to 15 is inevitable. White has secured the top, but Black's thickness in the center is strategically overwhelming. <= ]

(;W[le]
C[Variation.  

The diagonal move of White 2 is another possibility. ]

C[Variation.  

If White slides to 2, ... ]
;B[jc]
C[... Black will force White to run along the second line. ]

C[After the sequence to 13, Black's wall in the center is superior to White's territory at the top. <= ]
))
(;B[me]
C[Failure.  

Turning at 1 is not a good move ... ]
;W[ld]
C[... because White is able to make territory by running on the fourth line ... ]

TR[fc]
C[... and the marked stone works well in protecting White's left flank. Moreover, the two white stones on the right side neutralises Black's wall. <= ]
