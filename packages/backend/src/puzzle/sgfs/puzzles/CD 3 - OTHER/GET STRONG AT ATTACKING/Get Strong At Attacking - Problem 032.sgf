C[Correct Answer.  

The marked stones are thick, so Black should jump to 1 and drive the white stones toward that strong position. ]
;W[he];B[hc];W[je];B[ji]
C[White will probably live in gote, but Black is satisfied with the moyo he has staked out at the bottom. <= ]

C[Failure.  

Black 1 is overly defensive. ]
;W[fi]
TR[di]
C[White will immediately take the initiative and attack the marked stone with 2. With his thick position at the top, Black's territory is overconcentrated. <= ]
