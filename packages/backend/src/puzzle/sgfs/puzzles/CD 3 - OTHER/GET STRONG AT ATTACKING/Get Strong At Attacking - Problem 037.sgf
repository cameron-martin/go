White's stones at the top are heavy. How should Black attack them ? ]

Black 1, threatening to separate the white stones, is the vital point of this position. ]

C[White must defend against the cut with 4 and ... ]

TR[ld]
C[... Black continues the attack with 4. The marked black stone is on the vital point, depriving White of eye shape. <= ]

C[Variation.  

White could draw back to 2. ]

C[Again, Black connects at 3. White would like to play A or B, but if she does, her stones at the top could get into trouble. On the other hand, Black is free to attack the white stones in the lower right with a pincer at C. <= ]

C[Failure.  

Black 1 is not a good move. ]

Pushing along the top with 1 ... ]
