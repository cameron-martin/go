C[... for White 2 is natural, ... ]
;B[nf]
C[... but Black 3 is a move that many players would miss. However, it is important because, if White were to play on this point, the black stones at the top would be separated. ]
(;W[mj]
C[White moves out with 4, ... ]
;B[pi]
C[... but Black attacks with 5. This move is also sente against the white stones in the corner, ... ]

C[Variation.  

In response to the marked stone, White might jump out into the center with the knight's move of 4. ]
;B[ni]
C[Black attacks with 5 ... ]
;W[mi];B[nj]
C[... and 7, ... ]

C[... and 17; ... ]
;W[df]
C[... White must defend in gote with 18. ]
;B[fq]
C[Finally, Black reinforces his corner with 19.  

In this attack, Black hasn't really gone all out for the kill. Instead, he has built up his territory on the right with moves that threaten White's stones. He gets the initiative on the left by attacking the white stones in the upper left. Black is now far ahead. This is a good example of the correct way to attack. <= ]
