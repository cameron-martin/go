C[Problem 168. White to play.  

This position is taken from a game played between Takemiya (Black) and Otake. Takemiya likes to map out big moyos and that is what he has done here. Where do you think Otake should play ? ]

C[Correct Answer.  

We have marked another line for your convenience. If you were Otake, would you have entered into the black moyo as far as White 1 ?  

Black has a lot of weak point at A, B, and C, so you want to play within striking distance of these points. This is why Otake decided to play at 1. ]

C[Takemiya was concerned about an invasion. If he played 2, ... ]

C[... the invasion at 3 would be very disconcerting. <= ]

C[If Black played a capping move with 2, however, ... ]

C[Failure.  

A deep invasion with White 1 cannot be dismissed, but ... ]
;B[jk]
C[... the cap of Black 2 could be troublesome. White's stone would probably live, but with Black's thickness above it, it would be hard for White to gain any advantage. <= ]

C[Failure.  

White 1 is not a good erasing move. ]

C[Black would answer with 2. There may still be an invasion at A, but Black would defend at B and get a lot of territory below. <= ]

TR[ll][ki]
C[Failure.  

White 1 is too near the thick black wall above, so it cannot be very good. ]

C[For the time being, Black would play at 2, just as in the actual game. <= ]

C[... lets Black perfect his moyo with 2. White will make some intrusion into it, but Black can expect a large territory around here when the game is over. = ]
