C[Problem 162. White to play.  

White's stones don't seem to have any weaknesses. Therefore, this would be a good time to attack Black's moyo. How should White play ? ]

C[Correct Answer.  

If Black jumps to A, his moyo at the top will become huge. For that reason, the shoulder hit of White 1 is the right move. <= ]

C[The moves to Black 6 are the standard responses, but ... ]

C[...with 7, 9, and 11, ... ]

C[... then jumping to 13, White gets a large moyo in the center of the board. In spite of Black 6, White doesn't have to worry about her two stones in the upper left corner because the are quite tight. <= ]

(;W[je]
C[Failure.  

White 1 is not deep enough. ]
;B[kd]
C[Black responds with 2, making a beautiful shape at the top and securing a lot of territory as well. <= ]

(;W[kc]
C[Failure.  

A deep invasion at 1 is an overplay. ]
;B[jd]
C[Even if White managed to live on the side, the thickness Black would get in the center is more than enough compensation. <= ]
