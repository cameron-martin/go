C[Correct Answer.  

The marked stones on the right side are heavy, so Black should take a bit point at the bottom with 1. This move even has the effect of defending the cut at A by making a ladder-blocking move at the bottom more difficult for White. Regardless, Black should be flexible enough to sacrifice the marked stones should that become necessary. The white stones above are settled, so Black has no prospects for attack by saving these stones. <= ]
