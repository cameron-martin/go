C[Problem 47. Black to play.  

Black answered the marked stone in Problem 43 with 1. White then invaded the corner with 2 and lived in sente with the sequence to 8. Next, White started operations at the bottom with 10. How should Black continue after White attaches at 14 ? ]

C[Correct Answer.  

It is not possible to kill the white stones, so Black should confine White in the corner and take as much profit as possible. To this end, Black 1 is the strongest move. ]
