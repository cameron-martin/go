C[Problem 134. Black to play.  

The game in Problem 131 continued with Black jumping down to 1 and White invading with 2. How should Black respond ? ]

C[Correct Answer.  

Black 1 defends the corner and severely attacks the invading white stone. If White runs away into the center, her stones will be heavy and Black will gain more profit by attacking them. ]

C[Therefore, she attaches at 2 and tries to make a base at the bottom right ... ]

C[However, Black secures the territory at the bottom left as well as in the lower right corner, while White's stones there are still not secure. <= ]

C[How the game continued.  

Black 1 was a slack move. ]

C[White stabilised her stones at the bottom ... ]

C[Next, White can invade at A. Depending on how Black responds, White B could become a big endgame move. The balance of territory was now beginning to look unfavourable for Black. <= ]
