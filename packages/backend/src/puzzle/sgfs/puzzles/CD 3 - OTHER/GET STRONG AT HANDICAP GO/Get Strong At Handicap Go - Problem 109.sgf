Black 1 also secured the corner, but the situation there is still undefined and White's stones at the top were light and flexible. In addition, the possibility of White A was an annoyance to Black. ]

C[Since the two white stones in the upper left were in no immediate danger, White made an approach at 2, preparing to attack the black stone on the left side. <= ]
