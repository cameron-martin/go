C[Correct Answer.  

White's stone on the right side is outnumbered, so playing there is not urgent. Instead, Black should extend to 1, aiming to play the sequence Black A - White B - Black C - White D - Black E. The white stones at the bottom would then be in disarray. <= ]

C[... White opens a new battlefield with 4. The fighting around will now be difficult, but, if Black had a stone at A, he would have a clear advantage. <= ]
