C[Problem 131. Black to play.  

White has just jumped with the marked stone, threatening to engulf a large area at the top. Taking a global view of the position, where is the best point for Black to play ? ]

C[Correct Answer.  

Black 1 is a powerful move. It aims at either A, which takes the territory in the upper right, or B, which encloses the corner and attacks the lone white stone in the lower right. ]

C[How the game continued.  

Black 1 had only one aim: to secure the stones in the upper left corner. While it is a good move locally, it failed to take a global view of the board and had almost no attacking potential. Such moves are always bad. ]
;W[rk]
C[White took this pause in the fighting to give her stones on the right some flexibility by sliding to 2, neutralising the effect of Black's wall above. <= ]
