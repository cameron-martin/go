The hane of Black 1 is severe. ]

C[However, Black takes the corner with 5. Black's influence at the bottom is thick and he can still threaten the white stones with A. <= ]

C[Variation.  

After Black connects at 3, White could go for the corner with 4 ... ]
;B[rn];W[pr]
C[... and 6. ]
;B[rp];W[qs];B[oq];W[rq];B[so];W[nr];B[or];W[os];B[mq]
C[However, when Black cuts with 15, White is without a good follow-up. Again White is confined to the corner and Black is thick on the outside. IN handicap games, Black should always strive to make thick positions such as this and the one in the correct answer. <= ]
