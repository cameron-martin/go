C[Problem 60. Black to play.  

In the game in Problem 56, White made a lot of profit in the upper right corner. Black then extended with the marked stone and the game continued to White 13. Where should Black play next ? ]

TE[2]
C[Correct Answer.  

Black might be able to live at the top, but escaping into the center with 1 is better because the four white stones in the upper left will be stranded without a base. ]

C[How the game continued.  

Black thought he could escape with 1 as well, but this move was off the mark. ]

C[White, on the other hand, managed to link up all of her stones, so these moves must be considered a complete failure for Black. White could still threaten the corner and the black stones at the top by jumping to A. <= ]
