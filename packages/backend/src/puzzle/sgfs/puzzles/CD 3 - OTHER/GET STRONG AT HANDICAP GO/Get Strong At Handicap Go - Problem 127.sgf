C[Problem 127. Black to play.  

The game in Problem 123 continued with the moves of Black 1 and White 2. Where should Black play next ? ]

C[Correct Answer.  

Black makes an iron pillar with 1, ... ]
;W[ic]
C[... inducing White to defend the top by extending to 2. ]
;B[cg]
C[Next, Black 3 is a severe attack. ]
;W[bg];B[ch];W[df]
C[White resists with 6, but ... ]
;B[eg]
LB[dc:1][cc:A]
C[... Black simply extends to 7, making thickness in the center. White's three stones on the upper left side might be able to live, But Black's resulting thickness will neutralise White's four-stone wall below. You might wonder why Black doesn't anchor his stones to the 3-3 point at A as in Problem 74 instead of playing 1. The reason is ... ]
;W[ee]
C[White might try to separate the black stones by exchanging 8 ... ]
;B[de]
C[... for 9 later in the game, but ... ]
;W[bh]
C[... White will have to take care of her stones on the left, so she can't do this in sente. ]

C[Therefore, Black will be able to link up with the crosscut tesuji of 15. The white marked stones can't avoid being captured. <= ]

C[How the game continued.  

Black secured a link to his stones on the outside with 1, but ... ]
;W[gd]
C[... this attachment needlessly strengthened White's stones. ]
;B[fe];W[cc];B[ec];W[gc];B[cd];W[bd];B[bb];W[bc];B[cb];W[dh]
C[With the sequence to 12, White secured territory on the left side and her three stones at the top were now resilient enough to survive any attack. <= ]
