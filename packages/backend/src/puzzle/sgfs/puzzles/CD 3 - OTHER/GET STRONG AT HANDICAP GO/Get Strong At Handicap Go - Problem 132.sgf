C[Problem 132. Black to play.  

In the game continuation of Problem 128, Black should have jumped to A. Instead he exchanged 1 for White 2, which weakened his stones below. How can Black savage the position ? ]

C[Correct Answer.  

Black should cut with 1. Even though the three black stones on the right are short of liberties, they still have enough room to escape. ]

C[How the game continued.  

Jumping to 1 revealed a negative attitude. ]
;W[mj]
LB[oo:B][pg:A]
C[White connected with 2 and her stones on the right became strong because they had access to the center. In the upper right, White can aim at breaking Black's shape by playing on the vital point of A, perhaps living there as well. In the lower right, the peep at White B will also be troublesome for Black. <= ]
