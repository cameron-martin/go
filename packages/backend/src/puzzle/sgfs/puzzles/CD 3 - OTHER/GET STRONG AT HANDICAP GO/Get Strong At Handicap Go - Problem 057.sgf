C[Problem 57. Black to play.  

After the sequence in the game in Problem 53, Black 1 and White 2 were exchanged. Where should Black play next ? ]

C[Correct Answer.  

Black caps at 1 to keep the lone white stone there under control and to prevent it from doing any damage. ]

C[Before escaping into the center, White first makes shape for her stones with 2 ... ]

C[Even if White lives, Black is not unhappy because he has taken the corner and become strong in the center with 9. <= ]

C[How the game continued.  

Black played 1 to prevent White from making a base. But this cannot be considered a good move ... ]
;W[cg]
LB[ce:A]
C[... because it provoked White to strengthen her stone with 2 (Black A would have been the appropriate move here). Black's two stones on the left side are were now more vulnerable than before. See Problem 61 for the continuation. <= ]
