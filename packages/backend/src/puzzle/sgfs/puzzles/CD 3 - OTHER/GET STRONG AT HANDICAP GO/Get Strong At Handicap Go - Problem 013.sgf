C[Problem 13. Black to play.  

White cuts with 9. How should Black respond ? ]

TE[2]
C[Correct Answer.  

The proverb advises, 'When caught in a crosscut, extend !'. Black should follow this maxim by extending to 1 and strengthening his stones toward the edge. This gives him two ways to save his stones on the side. ]

C[If White extends to 2, ... ]
;B[pg]
C[... Black ataris with 4. ]
;W[qc]
C[It is unreasonable to try and save the stone in atari, so White might jump to the corner with 4. ]

C[Black will block with 5 and ... ]
;W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[ob];B[nb];W[oc];B[nc];W[od];B[oe]
C[... confine White to the corner with the sequence to 15. ]
;W[pc]
C[White ends in gote, so ... ]
;B[ok]
C[... Black can separate White's stones in the center from the one on the side with 17. For this reason, White won't invade at 4 immediately. Instead, she will leave it in reserve as aji and strengthen her stones in the center first. <= ]

C[Black 7 now leaves White with two weak groups to defend. This result is bad for White. <= ]
