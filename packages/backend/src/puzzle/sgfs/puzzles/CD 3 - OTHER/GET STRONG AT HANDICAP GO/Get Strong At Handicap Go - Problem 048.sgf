C[Problem 48. Black to play.  

How should Black respond to White 7 ? ]

C[Correct Answer.  

Since White has a stone on the upper right side, it doesn't make sense to attack at A as in Problem 43. ]
;W[mp];B[no];W[oq];B[pq]
C[Instead, Black can make good shape with the attach-and-extend joseki with the sequence to Black 5. ]
;W[qj]
C[If White next attaches at 6, ... ]
;B[kp]
C[... Black will attack the white stones at the bottom with 7 ... ]
;W[mo];B[mn]
C[... and 9, ... ]
;W[lo];B[pn]
C[... then defend his position with 11. ]
;W[pi]
LB[qi:A]
C[White can't neglect 12, since the hane of Black A is too severe to allow. ]
;B[lr]
C[Next, Black attacks White ... ]
;W[mq];B[jn]
(;W[km];B[jm];W[kl];B[jl];W[kk];B[ij]
C[... with the sequence to 21, building a large-scale moyo in the lower left. <= ]

C[Variation.  

In answer to Black 15, it is unreasonable for White to cut through with 16 ... ]
;B[jo];W[jp]
C[... and 18. ]
;B[ip];W[jq];B[iq];W[jr];B[ir];W[kq];B[js];W[ks];B[is]
C[White lives, but Black can squeeze her with the sequence to 27, building a thick position on the bottom left. ]
;W[kr]
C[Finally, White must defend at 28 in gote, so Black can now switch to the upper left and attack the white stone there. <= ]

C[How the game continued.  

Black pincered with 1 ... ]
;W[ol]
C[... and White jumped to 2. ]
;B[pr]
C[Defending the corner with 3 was territorially tight, but it didn't solve the problem of the weak black stone on the right side. ]
;W[md]
C[In relation to this, White 4 was a bit troublesome. See Problem 52 for the continuation. <= ]
