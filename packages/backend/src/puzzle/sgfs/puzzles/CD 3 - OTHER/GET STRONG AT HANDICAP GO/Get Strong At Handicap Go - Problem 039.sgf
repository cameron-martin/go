C[Problem 39. Black to play.  

White attacks the two black stones in the upper left at their weak underbelly with 5. How should Black respond ? ]

C[Correct Answer.  

Black should first attach with 1, ... ]

C[... forcing White to stand with 2. ]
;B[ge]
C[If Black next moves out into the center with 3, ... ]
;W[jd]
C[... White's stones at the top need reinforcement, so she defends with 4. ]

C[Black now attacks with 5 ... ]

C[Black now leans on the white group at the top with 11 ... ]

C[When Black plays 31, White's stones at the top have bad aji and her stones in the center are heavy and lack eyes. <= ]

C[The order of moves.  

Black 1 is a splendid move ... ]
;W[jd]
C[... that requires a white response at the top. ]
;B[ce]
LB[ge:1][df:A]
C[But, with the black stone of 1 in place, White will not play A in response to Black 3. ]
;W[cn]
LB[df:A]
C[Instead, she will approach in the lower left with 4. This is a subtle point, but a strong player never makes a move like A which clearly leads to a bad position. It is better to play elsewhere and wait to see how the situation in the upper left develops. <= ]
