C[Correct Answer.  

The atari from the bottom with Black 1 is the strongest move. ]
;W[cm]
C[White must not connect at 2 (she should make an approach move in the upper left), because her stones will come under severe attack ... ]
;B[bm]
C[... when Black crawls to 3. ]

C[How the game continued.  

Black cut with 1. This was a joseki move, but there was the aji of White A or White B that Black had to worry about. Moreover, the handicap stone on the left side was not working to its full potential as in the Correct Answer. ]

C[Next, White made a low approach with 2 and a fight soon broke out along the left side. <= ]
