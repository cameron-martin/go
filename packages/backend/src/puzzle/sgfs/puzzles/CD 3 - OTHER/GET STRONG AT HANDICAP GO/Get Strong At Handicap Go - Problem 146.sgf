Extending to Black 1 is a standard response to the low approach of the marked white stone. ]

C[White's stones are still not secure and Black has expanded his moyo in the bottom right. Meanwhile, his territory on the lower left side is still intact and White must worry about her endangered stones. <= ]

;W[jj]
C[... White 10 is the key point for wiping out  Black's moyo. White's gain in the corner is too big with respect to what Black can expect to gain from his moyo. Moreover, White can make incursions into Black's moyo on the left and the right from her corner. ]
