C[This play is a perfect extension from Black's thickness along the top.

On the other hand, White's territory at the top is no big deal, especially given the low posture of the upper left stones.  White doesn't get enough out of the territory exchange.

Already, White has little chance of saving the game.]

    C[Black can now block here...];

    C[But White lives easily in the corner with this play, and Black's previous strong blocking move is facing a rock solid White position in the upper left.

White's position is nothing to envy, but White does avoid the frightful result of the previous variation. ]
