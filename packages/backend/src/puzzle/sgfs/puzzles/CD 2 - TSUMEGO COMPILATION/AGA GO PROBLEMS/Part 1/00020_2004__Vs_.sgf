C[White's natural response is attractive.
White forms a double wing formation
around the upper left corner, and
Black becomes bottom heavy.  In a
sense, the marked stones make
Black's previous move redundant.]

    C[In spite of White's last move,
Black's lower left corner is in no
grave danger, because of the strong
lower right Black stones that are
next to weak White stones.]

positive Black result, Otake felt that
he should have played here instead.]
