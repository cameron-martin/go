Black's move aims to
overconcentrate White along the top
where White already has overwhelming influence,
while also creating Black forcing moves
on the outside to build the Black moyo on
the right side. ];

    C[White reinforces and solidifies, but more
importantly, exposes a weak point in
Black's position at A.  Black would hate
to have to go back to defend at A.

The correct line sacrificed two Black stones
to eliminate this weakness.]

his moyo, and leave the lone White
stone on the right side as "light".]
