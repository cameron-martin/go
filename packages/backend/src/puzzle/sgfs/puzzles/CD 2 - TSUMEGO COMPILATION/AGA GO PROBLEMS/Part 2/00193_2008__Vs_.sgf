C[Inferior.  White's play is certainly on a good point, but White misses a chance to take advantage of Black's weak position along the top.];
B[kf]
C[With one move, Black takes care of his weakness along the top.];
W[gp]
C[White can try to expand the moyo, but ...];
B[dj]
C[... Black only needs to build up the left side here to stay ahead in potential territory.];
W[gn];B[kk]
C[Black has no fear invading White's framework here because Black's upper side is very strong.  Black has the lead.]

    W[cj]
    C[Inferior.  The left side is big, but Black's weakness at the top is even bigger.];
    B[kf]
    C[Again, Black protects the top weakness.];
    W[cm];B[eg]
    LB[nk:A]
    TR[ql][on][mo]
    C[Black only needs to make a simple move here to keep all his groups safe and maintain the lead.

Note that Black could also have played at A, because Black has forcing moves at the marked points.]

    C[Based on the previous variations, a White play here should now be obvious.  The details are somewhat involved, but instructive.];
    B[kd]
    C[If Black holds onto the top area here, the next few moves are a one-way street.];
    W[jd];B[ld];W[jc];B[id];W[ie];B[jf];W[he];B[jg]
    C[Black has kept the top intact, but must spend a move to prevent White's ladder here.];
    W[ib]
    C[But now White has time for a beautiful squeeze.];
    B[hc];W[gc];B[hb];W[gb];B[jb];W[kb];B[ia];W[gd];B[lc]
    C[Black must spend another move to prevent the top area from collapsing.  With sente, White can now invade the left side.  White is the one who is leading.

This problem required some reading, but that is true for every plan or blueprint.]
