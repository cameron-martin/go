C[Correct.

This reducing move is similar to last week's problem, although some important tactical differences do exist.];

C[In this position, White's play here is most effective.  Don't worry about all the tactical issues, just play through the variations here for a feel for the general concepts.];

C[White has reduced Black's sphere influence, while solidifying his overall position.  White also has easy access to the center.  This sequence is one possible fair exchange between both players.]

    C[And although White does not have to worry about creating 2 eyes, White's
center access is more difficult.  Unnecessarily submitting to such pressure is not good. ]

    C[Inferior.

White's stylish move makes life in the corner or on the side, but the resulting overall position is bad for White.]

        C[White has made some good tactical moves to make life and some territory, but has lost the battle.  Black's outside influence is tremendous.]
