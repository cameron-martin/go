C[Black will ignore White's approach to play here.  Black simultaneously takes advantage of his thickness below, and also supports his upper left stone.  Black has an ideal shape.]

    C[Taking the point that Black wants (or one point to the right) is the correct direction, but the wrong point.];

    C[This White play is just a little too far from the White stone in the lower left.];

    C[Black builds good thickness, but Black's pincer doesn't make the maximum efficiency with the lower wall.]
