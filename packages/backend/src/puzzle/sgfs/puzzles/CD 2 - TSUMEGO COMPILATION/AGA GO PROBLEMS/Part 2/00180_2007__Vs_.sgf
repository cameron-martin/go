        C[Black would more likely play here, offering up the 2 marked stones.

Numerous possibilities exist, but the result is the same, viz., White's corner lives and Black is left with a weakness somewhere on the outside.

So sometimes following the joseki books, assuming you know what's in them, is a good plan!]

        C[White misses an opportunity in this game line.

The funny thing is that Rin, who knew that Black's previous move was not joseki, feared that Black had a secret prepared variation!

So Rin played here, instead of where he knew from joseki books was the proper response to Black's misplay!];
