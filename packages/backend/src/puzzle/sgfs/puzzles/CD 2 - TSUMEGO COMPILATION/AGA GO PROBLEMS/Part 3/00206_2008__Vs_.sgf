C[The endgame value of this play is:  how many MORE points does Black have plus how many FEWER points does White have, than if White had played here first.];
W[]
C[After Black's 1st play, White only has a small gote play on the top, so White almost surely will play elsewhere.];

C[So this sente hane will be Black's privilege later.];

C[Now remember this position for reference against the next variation in which White plays first.]

    C[The next question to answer is what the position would most likely look like after White plays here first.];
    B[pb];W[na]
    C[After this play, a White hane would be gote, because Black would just block and White would have to connect.

So later, Black would most likely have time to descend here.];
    B[pa];W[oa]
    C[And White would finish here.

In the previous variation, Black has 3 more points of corner territory than here, while White has 4 more points along the top plus the 1 captured stone.

So this play is worth 8 (3+5) points.

Simple, eh?  Of course, endgame plays can become much more involved, but the principle shown here still forms the basis of the calculations.]
