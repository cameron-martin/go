C[Correct.

Black should try to keep both White
groups in the upper right from connecting
or settling themselves too easily. ]

C[And if White is unable to start the ko
at A, Black B becomes an excellent
move for Black.

White has sente, but no especially good
point to play.  For example, if White C,
Black D, White E, Black F, and White's
right side is in trouble.

If White plays on the right side,  Black
can attack White's upper group at E.]
