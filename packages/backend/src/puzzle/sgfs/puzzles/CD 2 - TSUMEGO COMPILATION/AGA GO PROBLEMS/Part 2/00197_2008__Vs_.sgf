C[If Black is aiming for a pincer, then this immediate play is simple and OK, especially given that this game starts with a 3 stone handicap.  Black has effective responses to a White attack against the upper left corner. ]

    C[Needlessly complicated.

If Black already had another stone extending down the side with a 1-space jump from the handicap point, then this play along with the follow up pincer on the right would have been perfect for Black.];

    C[But Black's previous move forces White to strengthen himself here.  Now expanding to the right or attacking Black's corner is miai for White.];

    C[Correct response.];

    C[Up to here is a joseki.  Black has taken nice corner territory, but White's formation is already solidly connected and radiates power outward.  Black is better in the main line.]

        C[In the game, White actually made this overplay.];
        B[cc]
        C[But instead of making the best of the situation by counterattacking with a splitting atari on the 5-5 point, Black submissively protects the corner here.];
        W[ee]
        C[And White's pull back here leaves Black with a relatively small and isolated corner, while White again has a safe group that radiates power outward.  Black's submissive play is just what White wants. ]
