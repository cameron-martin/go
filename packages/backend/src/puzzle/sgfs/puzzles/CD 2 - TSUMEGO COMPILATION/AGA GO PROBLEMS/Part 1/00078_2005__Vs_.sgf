With Black's strong marked stone

    C[Black will first take the big upper left 3-3
point, but then come back to invade here.

A White response at A leaves White
with a cramped corner.

After a White response at B instead of A,
Black lives underneath and White's shimari
in the lower right yields little or no
territory.]

White has to defend with A, but Black
is expanding on a large scale.

If White ignores Black's approach,
Black dives to B and White will have
to take emergency measures to make
some kind of living shape.]
