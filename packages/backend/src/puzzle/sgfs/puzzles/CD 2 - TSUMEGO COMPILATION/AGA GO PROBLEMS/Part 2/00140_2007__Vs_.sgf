C[White's response to Black's
marked move?

The upper right is the Kajiwara joseki.
Probably 70% of pros would prefer Black's
profit to White's influence, but as in
this game, everything depends on the
rest of the board.

C[Inferior.
White doesn't make the most of the
joseki in the upper right.

The upper right edge is open, so
White's play here, stressing territory
at the top, is wrong.];

C[White continues with his
mis-direction in play with 11,
which should be at A.

After White 11, Black takes
the key point at A.  With the
upper right edge open, Black later
easily invades and wins the game.]

This pincer works well with
the White stones from the
joseki in the upper right.];
