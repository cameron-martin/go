C[Black's best play locally.

The endgame value of this play is:  how many MORE points does Black have plus how many FEWER points does White have, than if White had played in this area first.

See the variation for the result if White plays first from the original position.];

C[And near the end of the game, after Black and White fill in the points at A,B,C,D, White must play here, and the position ends with White living with 6 points of territory.

Note that if White neglects to defend here, Black ataris on the same point, and with 2 more moves, forms a seki.  White would lose 6 points.]

    C[... White's privilege will be this sente move.];

    LB[go:A]
    C[So the value of this endgame situation is 11 points because:

When Black goes first, Black has 5 more points of territory along the bottom edge.

And when White goes first, White has 6 more points (3 more points of territory along the bottom edge, 1 more point of territory at A, and 2 points from capturing the Black stones).]

    C[Note that a White play here is slack.];
    B[is]
    C[Black simply connects in sente.];
    W[gs]
    C[After White captures, White is already 1 point worse than the previous variation, because White 1 plays inside what should have been White's own territory.]
