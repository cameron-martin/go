will come under attack because
White's formation in the lower
left lies in wait.  Also, White's
stones keep Black's moyo at
the top in check.]

    C[Splitting Black up through 6 seems
too painful.  But on the other hand,
surrounding the top with 7 might
be OK.  If Black had played as in the
previous variation, White might have
been able to invade Black's upper
side more easily.]
