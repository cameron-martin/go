C[Best.

Black cannot effectively attack the center
White group, so the game's focal point is
what Black can do with his moyo.

Black 1 works best with both Black's wall
and Black's upper right corner stone.];

    C[Second best.

Black 1 is solid, but doesn't use all of Black's
stones as effectively.
The top center is wide open for White.]

    C[Bad.

Black's strategy is misguided.
Black's move "leans" on the White center group
that is fairly immune to attack.];

    C[White ignores Black to make the ideal
extension here.]
