C[Correct.

Black creates an ideal double wing formation off of the strong upper right corner.  At the same time, Black aims at invading White's upper left formation at A or B.

For similar reasons White would have liked to play at C before Black 1.  The difference between Black 1 and White C is enormous.]

    C[Second best.

Black solidifies the corner and aims at attacking White's side group.  Black 1 is also big, but the Black play at the top is even bigger.]

    C[Third best.

Although large, Black 1 does not have the territory making and follow up potential as Black's other two moves.  Any other Black moves rank even lower.]
