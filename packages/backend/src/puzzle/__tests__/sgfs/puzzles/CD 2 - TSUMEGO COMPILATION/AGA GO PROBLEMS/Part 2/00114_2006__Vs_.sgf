C[Correct.
White does live, but this move is merely the best
among nothing but bad choices that White has.

However, the real point of working through the variations
of this problem is to see the difference between solving
stand-alone tsumego problems and finding the correct move
in a real game situation.

As a tsumego problem, this position is not even close to
being professional level, yet both of these top-ranked
professionals missed the correct plays during a game!];
