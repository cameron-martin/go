C[Correct.

In this case, White should erase Black's moyo, instead of invade.

White could invade the upper right corner, but Black would press down on White.  White would live small, and Black would have a large area in the upper right quadrant with stones along the top and right middle.  The result would would not be good for White.]

This result is very disadvantageous for Black.]

    C[White cuts off and menaces the two Black stones below.  With such a strong initial position, the last thing Black wants is to have to look after weak stones.]
