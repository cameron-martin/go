C[Problem 17. Black to play.  

Black ignores White's cap at 5 and strengthens his position in the lower left  with 6. How should Black respond to White's invasion at 7 ? ]

TE[2]
C[Correct Answer.  

Black should play the diagonal move of 1 and aim to confine White to the top ... ]

C[Note Black 7. After White 6 in this joseki, White can live on the side by playing at either A or B. Driving White into the corner and confining her there, where she can do the least strategic damage, is the correct choice for Black. ]

C[... with the sequence to 15. ]

C[White lives with 16, but, ... ]

C[... when Black plays 17, he gets territory on the left side and has foiled White's capping strategy. <= ]

C[How the game continued.  

Black defended the corner with 1. This was a reasonable move, ... ]

C[... but Black 3 was bad. He did gain some territory in the corner, but ... ]
;W[hc]
C[... it induced White to increase her influence on the right with 4. Black was still left with the problem of how to deal with White's two stones at the top. <= ]
