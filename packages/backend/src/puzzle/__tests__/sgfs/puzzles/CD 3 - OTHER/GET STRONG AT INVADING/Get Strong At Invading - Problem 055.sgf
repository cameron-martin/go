C[Problem 55. Black to play.  

The invasion of White 1 often occurs in handicap games. How should Black respond ? ]

TE[2]
C[Correct Answer.  

The diagonal move of Black 1 is the strongest response. ]

C[Continuation 1.  

White jumps down to 6: she aims at either A or B. ]

C[Black 8 is best, taking the larger territory on the left. ]
;W[oc]
C[With 8, White starts making two eyes at the top. ]
;B[od];W[md];B[ne];W[nc];B[pc];W[pb];B[qb];W[oa]
C[The moves to 16 are joseki and White's group at the top is alive. Black is satisfied with his territory at the top left and his thickness in the center. <= ]

Attacking from the right with Black 7 is also possible. ]

LB[me:B][mf:4]
C[Failure.  

When White hanes with 4, Black must cut with B (5 in the Correct Answer). Playing 5 as here is timid. ]

C[White gets a good result when she connects with 6. <= ]

TE[2]
C[Correct Answer.  

Playing the diagonal move of Black 2 from the right is also correct. It often transposes into the position of the Correct Answer starting with Black A. <= ]

TE[2]
C[Correct Answer.  

Jumping to 2 is also possible. ]

C[After White 2, ... ]
;B[og]
C[... Black jumps to 3, attacking the white stones on both the right and left. If you are good at fighting, you can play this way. <= ]

C[Failure.  

Black 1 is overly defensive. ]
(;W[lf]
C[After White jumps to 2, ... ]
;B[lc]
C[... Black must defend again at 3. Black has enormous power at the top, so he must not play so submissively. <= ]

C[Failure.  

Attaching at 1 is not recommended. ]

C[Black can take territory at the top, but White's ponnuki gives her the strategic advantage. <= ]

C[Failure.  

Attaching underneath with Black 1 is also bad. ]
;W[kc]
(;B[kd];W[mc];B[le];W[lb];B[md];W[jc]
C[White lives at the top with the moves to 8. Black has no territory and his thickness is not very effective. <= ]

C[Very bad.  

Drawing back with 3 after attaching at 1 is very bad. ]

C[White connects at 4 and the marked stone has lost much of its value. White also has the option of invading at A. <= ]

C[Variation.  

White might respond to Black 1 by jumping to 2. ]
