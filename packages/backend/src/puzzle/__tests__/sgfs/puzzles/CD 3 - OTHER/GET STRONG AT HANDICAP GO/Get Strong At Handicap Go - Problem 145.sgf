C[Problem 145. Black to play.  

Black is thick, but he doesn't have any territory. White, on the other hand, has iron-clad territory in two corners. Where should Black play so as to best utilise his thickness ? ]

C[Correct answer.  

Making a sanren-sei at the bottom has a good feel to it. All of Black's stones are facing the center and working as one strategic force. ]

C[Failure.  

Black 1 is small. Black does get some territory at the top, but not much more than he got in the Correct Answer. ]

C[White immediately establishes a beachhead at the bottom with 2 and Black's stones are not working together as efficiently as they were in the Correct Answer. <= ]
