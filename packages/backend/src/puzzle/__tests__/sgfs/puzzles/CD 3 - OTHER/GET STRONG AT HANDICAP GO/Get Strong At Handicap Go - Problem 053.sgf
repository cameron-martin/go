C[Problem 53. Black to play.  

How should Black respond to White 9 ? ]

C[Correct Answer.  

Defending the corner with Black 1 is big, about 15 points. It also deprives White of a base for her stone in the lower left. ]
;W[dl]
LB[dm:A]
C[Black is threatening to engulf this stone with A, so White extends to 2. ]
;B[fj]
LB[fl:B][fg:C]
C[Next, Black jumps to 3, threatening to cap at either B or C. Jumping out into the center like this is always a good move in handicap games because Black ensures that this stone won't be attacked, he keeps the white stones separated, and he can attack one of the white groups. <= ]

C[How the game continued.  

Black jumped to 1. This was a slack move ... ]
;W[bp]
C[... because it allowed White to settle her stones on the left by sliding to 2 ... ]

C[... and playing the sequence to 8. See Problem 57 for the continuation. <= ]
