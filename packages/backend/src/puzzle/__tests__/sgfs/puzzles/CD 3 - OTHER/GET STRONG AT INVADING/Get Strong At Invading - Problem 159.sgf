C[Problem 159. Black to play.  

The position is similar to the one in Problem 157. However, there are some differences. These differences should influence the way you erase White's moyo. ]

C[Correct Answer.  

Since the marked stone is on the fourth line, light erasing moves such as caps or shoulder hits are not applicable. Black 1 is the perfect point because it aims at White's weak underbelly at A or a jump at B. ]

C[Variation.  

White might attach at 2. ]

C[Linking up to her stones at the top with 4 and 6 are big moves, but since White was strong here to begin with, this was to be expected. <= ]

C[Failure.  

Playing on the fourth line with 1 is bad. ]
