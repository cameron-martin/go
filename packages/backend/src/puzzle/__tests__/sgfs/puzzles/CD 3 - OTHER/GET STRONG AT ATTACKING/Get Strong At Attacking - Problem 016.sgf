C[Problem 16. Black to play.  

How can Black use his wall on the right side to attack the marked white stone ? ]

C[Correct Answer.  

The knight's move of Black 1 is the most effective way to attack. The white stone at the top is now in a pinch. ]

C[Trying to break out into the center with White 2 seems reasonable, but ... ]

LB[dj:A]
C[... sacrifices this stone and confines White to the top with the sequence to 9. The white stones are alive, but just like in the Correct Answer, Black gets a thick wall and he can then create a moyo by attacking the white stone on the left with a shoulder hit at A. <= ]

C[Variation.  

The diagonal attachment of White 2 is not good. After ... ]

(;B[ie]
C[Failure.  

Jumping out into the center with Black looks like a normal move, but it is slack. ]
;W[ke]
C[White jumps to 2, and Black doesn't have a good follow-up, so White's stones have escaped. <= ]

C[Failure.  

The diagonal move of Black 1 is also slack. ]

Capping is another common attacking technique, but, after Black caps with 1, ... ]
