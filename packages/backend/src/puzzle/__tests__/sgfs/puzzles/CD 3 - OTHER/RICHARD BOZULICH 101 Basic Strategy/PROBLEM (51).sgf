[hh:4][gi:3][ii:2][hj:1][gk:8]C[Black to play. After Black makes forcing moves with 1 and 3, he has to live with 5 and 7. White next peeps with 8. Is this a forcing move? How should Black answer?]

(;B[gl];W[hl];B[fk];W[hk];B[el];W[dm];B[gn]TR[gi][hj]C[CORRECT Black should sacrifice the two marked stones. Black makes sabaki while reducing White's moyo on the upper left side.])
(;B[gj];W[il]C[Black must not connect. This violates the principle of treating forcing moves lightly and sacrificing for the greater good. White can easily attack keeping the three Black stones heavy. A huge White moyo is taking shape throughout the board.]))
