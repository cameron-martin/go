C[Problem 118. Black to play.  

This position arose from the game in Problem 110. How should Black answer White 10 ? ]

C[Correct Answer.  

Black must wedge in with 1 to create defects in White's position. ]

C[After 15, White's stones on the upper left are in trouble. If White A, Black will rescue his two stones on the left by attacking the three white stones below. He will then make a huge moyo in the top right with an atari at B. If White B, Black engulfs the four white stones above with A. <= ]

Black 1 was bad style. It didn't help Black; ... ]
