C[... White must fix up her shape by playing at 8, while Black A is sente. Black is satisfied with this result. <= ]

C[Variation.  

If White wants to attack on the left, she will play 4 here. ]

LB[ja:B][ia:A]
C[The moves continue up to 9, and Black gets a large profit in the corner. However, a white move at A or B, threatening Black's stones on the left and right, could later become troublesome. <= ]
