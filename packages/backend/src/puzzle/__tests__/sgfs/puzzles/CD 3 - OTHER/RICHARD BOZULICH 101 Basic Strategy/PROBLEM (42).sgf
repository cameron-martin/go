(;B[lg];W[ng];B[ph];W[ni];B[nk]LB[qb:A]C[CORRECT Black should jump. If White doesn't run away, Black will play at A, and White's stones won't have eyeshape. White runs away playing on points of no value, while Black secures territory and builds a moyo.])

Black's sphere of influence on the right is thin, and it is White who is making profit by attacking.]))
