C[Correct Answer.  

Black 1 is a big move because it threatens A. Next, Black would play B, and a moyo would begin to form in the center. ]

C[This is not to White's liking, so she counters by extending to 2. ]
;B[qf]
C[But Black plays 3 and he gets a strong position in the upper right. <= ]

C[Failure.  

Black 1 aims at an invasion at A, but this is not much of a threat, since White B would be an adequate response. ]
;W[nc]
C[Therefore, White will take the initiative and make an approach move at 2. <= ]
