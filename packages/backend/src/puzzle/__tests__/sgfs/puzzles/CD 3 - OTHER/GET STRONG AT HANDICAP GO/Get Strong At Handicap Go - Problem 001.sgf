C[Problem 1. Black to play.  

White seems to be staking out a large territory at the top by capping with her marked stone. Black must run out into the center, but on which side: the right or the left ? ]

C[How the game continued.  

Black 1 was in the wrong direction. ]
;W[nf]
C[White jumped to 2, ... ]

C[... forcing Black to jump to 3. ]
;W[lb]
C[White then made a base for her stones with 4. Even though Black's stones have escaped into the center, they are thin and White will look for a chance to attack them. This is a good strategy for White in a handicap game: first strengthen your position, then wait for a chance to attack. <= ]
