(;B[pj];W[qf];B[od];W[qi];B[qj]C[CORRECT Black should start building a moyo by extending down the right side. White might invade, but he faces an uphill battle. When you have built a strong position, you welcome invasions like this, as you can seize the initiative by attacking the opponent.])
(;B[qn];W[pj]LB[nq:A]C[What if white doesn't answer at A as you had hoped for? White pincers Black, and Black is left without a moyo and it will be hard to utilize his thickness at the top.]))
