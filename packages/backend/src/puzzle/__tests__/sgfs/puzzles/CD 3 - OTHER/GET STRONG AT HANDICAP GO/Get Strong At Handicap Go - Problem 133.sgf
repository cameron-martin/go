C[... White was happy to settle her stones at the top by extending to 2. Later, White had two sente endgame moves: one at A, and the other at B, followed by Black C - White D - Black E. Thus, Black's territory was not at all that big. Black was thick, but using thickness to make territory is always bad. Thickness should be uses for attacking as in the Correct Answer. <= ]
