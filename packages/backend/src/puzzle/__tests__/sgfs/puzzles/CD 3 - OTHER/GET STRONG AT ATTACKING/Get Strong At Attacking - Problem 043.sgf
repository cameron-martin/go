C[Problem 43. Black to play.  

How should Black attack the marked white stones in the lower right ? ]

C[Correct Answer.  

Black 1 is severe because it attacks White's base. ]

C[If White jumps out to 2, ... ]
;B[mo]
LB[qq:B][nk:A]
C[... Black can defend at 3 or attack at A. He need not worry about an invasion at B because White must first secure her stones in the center before she can contemplate such an invasion. <= ]

C[Variation.  

If White makes a base for her stones with 2, ... ]
;B[nk]
C[... Black can attack at 3 ... ]

C[... and 5. ]

C[White must exchange 6 ... ]
;B[mk]
LB[lq:D][qq:C][ro:B][rm:A][ph:E]
C[... for 7 to maintain the link to the outside. If White gets into trouble in the center, she can make two eyes by playing at A, but Black B would then become sente and White can no longer invade at C. If White can secure her stones, she can aim to invade at D or E, but Black's strategy will be to try and strengthen these defects while attacking the white stones. <= ]

C[A solid move.  

Making an iron pillar with Black 1 is a solid move. Its appeal is that it prevents a white counterattack at A or an invasion at B. However, it lacks the attacking force of Black 1 in the Correct Answer (@), and, as such, is a bit passive. <= ]

(;B[mm]
C[Failure.  

Attacking with Black 1 doesn't press White hard enough. ]

C[White can secure her stones ... ]

LB[hq:C][lq:B][qq:A]
C[... with the sequence to 8. Black ends in sente, but with so many weak points - at A, B, and C - he won't be able to defend all of them. <= ]
