LB[el:B][mc:A]
C[... then play die diagonal move of 3, keeping White's stones at the top separated and aiming at the cut at A. White will have a hard time defending both of her groups at the top.

C[... with the sequence to 5. In some positions, these might be good moves, but in this case Black lost his chance to score a decisive win. ]

C[White secured all her stones at the top and made some territory there as well. ]

C[If Black had made an iron pillar with 7, however, this would be a satisfactory result. See Problem 29 for the continuation. <= ]
