C[Correct Answer  

Black should peep with 1, ... ]
;W[pf];B[rh]
C[... then make a placement at 3. ]
(;W[od]
C[White can no longer make two eyes on the right side, so she has to switch to the top and ... ]
;B[pc];W[nc];B[nb];W[mc];B[mb];W[lc]
C[... play the sequence to 10, inducing Black to secure the corner. ]

C[Black ends in sente, so he takes the key point of 11 to reach out to his stones above and to start building a moyo in the center. <= ]

C[Failure.  

The aim of 11 here is to map out a moyo with ... ]
;W[fi];B[lo]
C[... 13 and ... ]
;W[lp];B[jn]
C[... 15, but ... ]
;W[gk]
C[... White attaches at 16 and a sharp exchange ensues. ]
;B[gj];W[gl];B[fj]
(;W[hk]
C[White turns at 20 and Black's moyo becomes thin. <= ]
)
(;W[gh]
C[... White could also play 20 here attacking Black's stones at the top. ]
;B[hk]
C[Black would respond at 21. <= ]

(;W[re]
C[Variation.  

The placement of Black 3 is a flexible move. For example, if White exchanges 4 ... ]
;B[rd]
C[... for 5, ... ]
;W[qh];B[ri]
LB[qg:A][qh:6]
C[... Black can crawl to 7 if White plays 6. Since White has to defend her defect at A, Black will end in sente. <= ]
