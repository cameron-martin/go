C[Problem 157. Black to play.

Wedging in with Black 1 is the tesuji. ]

C[The sequence to Black 7 is inevitable. Because Black has the forcing exchange of Black A - White B, the white stones in the corner have bad aji. ]

C[Therefore, White has to defend with 8 and Black ends in sente. <= ]

C[White was able to make a big gain on the right with the sequence to 12. The three marked black stones still have some aji, but it is clear that Black has suffered a big loss compared with the Correct Answer. In addition, Black's wall has a defect since White can atari the stone at 7. <= ]
