C[Problem 164. White to play.

C[Correct Answer.  

Note the marked white stone in the corner: White has invested an extra stone in this area. There are three black stones to White's four. By playing 1, White is threatening to link up with her marked stone by attaching at A. ]

C[Black 2, which prevents the link-up, is the strongest response. ]

C[This enables White to settle her group with 5 and 7. White now need fear no attack because she can get a base with A or escape into the center with a knight move at B. <= ]
