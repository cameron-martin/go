C[Problem 169. White to play.  

Black maps out a huge moyo with the moves to 5. The way you counter it must be considered carefully. Do you go in lightly or with a bang ? ]

C[Correct Answer.  

Jumping in with White 1 was chosen because there was every expectation that White could live on the right side by playing this move. ]

C[... up to White 9, Black gets a strong wall on the outside. But White is not dissatisfied with the territory she has gotten on the right. What is worrisome is the blackness that pervades the center of the board. White has two ways into the center. ]

TE[2]
C[Correct Answer.  

It is also possible to play 1 here, and it would not be easy to kill this stone. <= ]

C[Failure.  

If White wanted to make an erasing move, White 1 would be a good guess. ]
;B[mj]
C[Black would respond by playing 2 and White's stone seems to be a little out of focus. It is always a perplexing problem to decide whether to erase or invade. You have to consider the distribution of stones, which stones are weak, the scale of the moyo, etc., in making your decision. <= ]
