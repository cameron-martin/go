(;W[hj];B[ih]C[CORRECT All of Black's stones are thick while White's stones at the bottom are eyeless within Black's sphere of influence. Therefore, Black should attack. These moves secure a vast territory in the center.])

(;W[gk];B[gi];W[fi];B[gh]C[CORRECT White's two space jump is a bit thin. Black will attach, then draw back. After White defends, Black can cut. White's stones might be able to live, but Black's territory in the center is too big.])
(;W[gi];B[gk];W[fk];B[gl]C[CORRECT White has to give up his eight stones at the bottom if he plays like this.])))
