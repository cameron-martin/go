C[Problem 4. Black to play.  

How should Black respond after White extends with the marked stone ? ]

C[Correct Answer.  

Two ways to maintain your advantage in high-handicap games are to keep your handicap stones connected and to force White's stones into a low position, while maintaining a high profile towards the center with your own stones. Black 1 achieves both these objectives. ]

C[... then settles the lower right side with 11. White's stones in the center are floating without a base and they will become a good target for Black to attack. <= ]

C[How the game continued.  

Black attached at 1 in the lower left. Since Black was strong around there, White didn't have a good move locally. A good strategy for White in handicap games is to play where her prospects are best. ]

C[Since turning at 2 was a strong move, this is where she played. White's position on the right was now thick and the marked stone, being close too close to this thickness, lost much of its power. <= ]
