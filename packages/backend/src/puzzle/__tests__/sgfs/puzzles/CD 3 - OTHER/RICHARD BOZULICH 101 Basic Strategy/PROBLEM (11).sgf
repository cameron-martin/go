;W[in];B[il];W[gm]C[If Black connects, then the marked stone has become a forcing move. White next plays a shoulder hit and escapes. Black's territory at the bottom has been wiped out.])
(;B[kq];W[oo];B[nq]LB[mp:A][mr:B]C[CORRECT Because Black's stones are thick, Black can let White cut and attack with the diagonal move. If White cuts, Black attacks. If White A, Black can link up with B; if White B, Black A traps the white stones. Either way, White will be under attack.]))
