C[This drives White into the center with 2 and 4, but ... ]

LB[rm:C][pk:B][pl:A][mi:3]
C[... Black can follow with 3 and 5 to map out a huge moyo in the upper right sector of the board. Later, Black can take some territory on the right side with the sequence Black A, White B, Black C. <= ]

C[Failure.  

Attacking with the knight's move of 1 is in the wrong direction. ]
;W[on]
C[White secures her stones with 2 and Black no longer has a vulnerable target. In the Correct Answer, Black naturally builds a moyo, while keeping White under pressure. White 2 also weakens the black stones below. <= ]
