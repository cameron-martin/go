;W[nk]
C[She then runs away into the center by taking the vital point of 6, but ... ]
;B[oi]

C[How the game continued.  

Black switched to the top, taking a big point at 1. The situation on the right remained fluid, but Black had certainly not fallen behind; he only lost a chance to take a decisive lead. ]

C[This pause allowed White establish a position in the lower left. ]
;B[dq];W[or]
C[She then switched to the lower right with 8. The game was becoming complicated. See Problem 45 for the continuation. <= ]
