C[Problem 160. Black to play.  

There are a lot of point where you can invade, but any invasion you make should take into account White's thickness on the right. ]

C[Correct Answer.  

Playing on the fourth line with White 1 is the best move. With a high move, escaping will be easy. For Black to try to link up at A would be submissive, so it is out of the question. ]

C[Black's best course is to jump out with 2. ]

C[However, White also jumps into the center with 3 ... ]

C[... and 5, and Black's moyo is erased. <= ]

(;B[hf]
C[Variation.  

Black might cap with 2 intending to build a moyo at the top. ]

C[... escapes into the center with the moves to 9. Black's wall of 4, 6, and 8 is now neutralised by White's wall on the right and, with White's thickness in the center, Black 2 has failed to increase the size of his moyo on the left. <= ]

C[Failure. A deep invasion with White 1 is dubious. ]

C[After Black 2 and 4, which hit White at her vital points, you will probably agree that the momentum of the game is in Black's favour. ]

LB[nd:4]
C[For example, if White answers 4 with 5, ... ]
;B[nc];W[ob];B[me]
C[... the sequence will continue up to 8. Black clearly has the advantage. <= ]

C[Failure.  

White 1 here is also a bad move, ... ]
;B[fd]
C[... because Black can answer with the knight move at 2, eliminating his thinness on the upper side. <= ]

C[Variation.  

Another way for Black to refute White 1 is to play 2 in response. This is a good move because it is in the right direction from the corner enclosure. <= ]
