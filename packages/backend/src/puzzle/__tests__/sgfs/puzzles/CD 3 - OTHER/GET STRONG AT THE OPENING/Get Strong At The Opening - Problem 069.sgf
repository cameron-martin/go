C[Problem 69. Black to play.  

Each side has staked out his sphere of influence. However, Black must now invade White's moyo. Where should he play ? ]

C[Correct Answer.  

Black should invade the lower left corner with 1. Since both the marked stones are on the third line, White can't expect to make a large-scale moyo because Black can cap at one of the points marked A. ]

C[Variation.  

White could also block from the other side with 2. ]

C[This time, however, Black will map out his moyo at the top with 13. This move also neutralises White's thickness below. If Black omits this move, White will map out a large-scale moyo by playing at A. After 13, Black still has the capping moves at the points B. <= ]

C[Failure.

C[... White will defend her position with 2 (or A) and Black will have a harder time erasing White's moyo. That is not to say that Black has a bad position, but he has lost his chance to decisively take the lead. <= ]
