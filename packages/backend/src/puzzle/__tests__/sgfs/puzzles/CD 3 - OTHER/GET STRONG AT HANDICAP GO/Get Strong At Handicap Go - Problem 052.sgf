C[Correct Answer.  

Black extends to 1, reaching out to the lone stone on the right. ]

C[If White tries to escape at the top with 2 ... ]
;B[jd];W[ke];B[je];W[kf]
C[... to 6, ... ]
;B[ig]
C[... Black is satisfied with the influence he gets in the top after jumping to 7. This is a great success for Black, since all of White's stones are unsettled. <= ]

C[How the game continued.  

Black haned at 1 ... ]
;W[lc]
C[... and White followed with another hane at 2. ]

C[Up to 10, White built thickness in the center and a moyo began to emerge. ]
;B[je];W[ic];B[kc]
C[With 13, Black got some territory at the top, but it was quite small compared to White's influence in the center. ]
;W[if]
C[White 14 was on the vital point and this move enabled White to expand her influence on an even grander scale. <= ]
