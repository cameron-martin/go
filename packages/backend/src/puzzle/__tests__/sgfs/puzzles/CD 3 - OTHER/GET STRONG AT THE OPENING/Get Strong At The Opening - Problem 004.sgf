C[Correct Answer.  

Black should take this opportunity to make a corner enclosure with 1.  

Instead of 1, making a corner enclosure with A or B would also be a good move. ]
(;W[qo]
C[Allowing Black to make a second corner enclosure in the lower right corner would give him a large territorial advantage, so White must make an approach move with 2. ]
;B[qk]
C[However, Black can now take the initiative by playing a pincer with 3. This move is also an extension from his corner enclosure above. <= ]

C[Variation.  

If White makes a high approach move with 2, ... ]

LB[qo:B][qm:A]
C[Black will play a two-space pincer with 3 or a pincer at A. Black 3 at B is also possible. <= ]
