C[How the game continued.  

Black 1 was a slack move. ]

C[It enabled White to remove her bad aji by capturing at 2. White now had a thick position radiating throughout the whole board. Allowing White to get such a thick position in the center is a sure recipe for defeat. A priority for White in handicap games is to remove any bad aji as soon as possible. <= ]
