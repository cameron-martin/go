C[Problem 163. White to play.  

Black has played 1, expanding the moyo he has made from the Chinese Opening and defying White to invade. How should White attack ? ]

C[Correct Answer.  

Lightly capping with White 1 is the correct strategy. It flattens Black's moyo ... ]

C[Failure.  

White 1 leaves something to be desired. ]

C[Failure.  

Locally, White 1 is an excellent move, but one of the strategic principles of Go is 'never let your opponent perfect his moyo.' ]
;B[ok]
C[This is exactly what Black does when he jumps to 2. Black's moyo is now very large and solid and Black has taken a commanding lead. <= ]

C[If White jumps to 3 here, ... ]
;B[ok]
C[... Black jumps to 4, making a moyo at the top and leaving the two white stones below under attack. <= ]
