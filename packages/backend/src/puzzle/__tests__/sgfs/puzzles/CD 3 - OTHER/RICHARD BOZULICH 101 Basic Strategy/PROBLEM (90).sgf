(;B[pl];W[ml];B[kj];W[kn];B[nf]LB[jm:A][jn:B][hm:C][fr:D]C[CORRECT Black should defend his position on the right side, and treat his two stones in the center lightly. If white goes after the lower stone, Black can let white trap it and put pressure on the three white stones on the right. As White struggles to secure these stones, Black will build a vast territory in the center. Later Black can reduce White's moyo with Black A, White B, Black C and eventually Black D.])
(;B[jo];W[qm];B[on];W[pl];B[nn];W[pk]C[If Black reinforces his stones in the center, White will invade. White secures his stones and territory on the right, but Black on the other hand has failed to take any profit.]))
