(;W[rb];B[qi];W[rd];B[re];W[sc]C[CORRECT Black should begin with the hane. If White plays a hane after Black's one point jump, Black jumps again. White captures one stone in gote, while Black gains a resilient, flexible group.])
(;W[qh];B[rb]C[CORRECT If White makes a pincer, Black extends into the corner and his stones are alive. No matter how White continues, Black makes sabaki.]))
