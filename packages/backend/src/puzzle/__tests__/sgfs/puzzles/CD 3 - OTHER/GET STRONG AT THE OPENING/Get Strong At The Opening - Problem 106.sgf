C[Problem 106. Black to play.  

The marked white stone is in the shadow of Black's thick wall at the top. How should Black attack it ? ]

C[Correct Answer.  

Black doesn't want to pincer too severely because White might decide to sacrifice her marked stone. Therefore, Black plays a two-space pincer with 1. ]

C[With the sequence to 9, Black is making good use of his thickness at the top. <= ]

C[Failure.  

When Black plays the approach move of 1, he thinks that White is going to respond with A, enabling him to pincer the white stone by extending to @. But this is too much to expect. ]

C[White would pincer at 2 instead, ... ]
;B[qq]
C[... and Black has no other alternative but to invade at 3. ]

C[With the joseki to 11, White has made thickness at the bottom, effectively neutralising Black's wall at the top. <= ]
