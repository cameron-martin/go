This is a continuation of the "Correct Answer of Problem 2". How should Black attack the two white stones on the right side ? ]

C[Correct Answer.  

Capping with Black 1 is the key point. ]

(;W[qk];B[rl];W[ql];B[rm]
C[... Black will gauge out White's base with the sequence to 7. White's stones are now floating in the center, providing an easy target to attack.  <= ]

White could block at 4, but ... ]

C[White still has to play 12 to secure her stones, so Black ends in sente.  <= ]

White could establish a position in the lower right by blocking at 6. ]
