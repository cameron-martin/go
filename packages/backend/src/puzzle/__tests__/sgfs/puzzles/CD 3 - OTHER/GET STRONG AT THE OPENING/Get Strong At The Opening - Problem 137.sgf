C[Problem 137. White to play.  

After Black plays the marked stone, the only interesting points remaining are at the top. Does White have any special stratagem at B or is there something else she should do ? ]

TE[2]
C[Correct Answer.  

There are no special tricks that White can pull off in the corner, so it is best for her to play 1, ... ]
;B[nc]
C[... forcing Black to defend at 2. ]
;W[id]
C[She can take up a position on the top with 3. The middle game now begins. <= ]

C[Failure.  

A move like 1 does nothing to improve White's position. ]
;B[kc]
LB[qd:B][qc:A]
C[Black 2 strengthens his weak stones at the top and takes profit besides. If White now peeps at A, Black simply connects at B and the stone at A is lost. <= ]
