C[Problem 99. Black to play.  

White attacks the black stones in the upper left with 7. A pincer against this stone is the usual response, but how far away should Black play it ? ]

C[Correct Answer.  

Black 1 is the ideal pincer against the white stone. ]

C[The sequence to Black 5 is a joseki. If White omits 4, Black will attack the two white stones above by playing at 4 himself. Timing is important, but if Black plays A later, the three white stones will be without a base, so White wants to play there as soon as possible. See Problem 84. <= ]

C[How the game continued.  

Black 1 was a lukewarm move. ]

C[It let White easily settle her stones on the left with 2 ... ]

LB[eg:1]
C[... and 4. This Black 1 had little effect on the white stones on the left and it was also too far away to have much effect on White's stones at the top. This is a good example of how White takes advantage of a slack black move. <= ]
