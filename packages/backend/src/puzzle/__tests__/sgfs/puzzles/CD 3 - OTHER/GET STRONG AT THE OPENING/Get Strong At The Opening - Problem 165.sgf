Taking into account Black's influence in the upper left, what is Black's strongest move ? ]

Black should play 1, making outside influence and restricting White to the corner. ]

C[White will play 2 and stake out a claim on the right side. White 2 also inhibits the development of a black moyo at the top, so now the exchange of the marked black and white stones in not good for Black. <= ]

C[Black 5 here certainly makes a moyo on a grand scale, but Black's position at the top is too thin to support it, so White will have an easy time invading it. <= ]
