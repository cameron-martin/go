C[Problem 171. White to play.  

Black has played 1. This is not such a good move. How should White counter it ? ]

C[Correct Answer.  

Although it may seen strange, White 1 is the correct response. You might want to make a more aggressive move to erase the black moyo, but White must be patient. You have to make your base strong before launching an all-out attack. ]

C[In order to prevent an intrusion into his moyo, Black drops back to 2. ]

C[Failure.  

White 1 is a losing move. ]

;W[oc]
LB[cc:A]
C[Next, Black can aim at invading the 3-3 point with A, so White's territory at the top is not so big. It is clear that White is the big loser in this exchange. <= ]

C[Correct Answer.  

For reference, let's look at another way White could answer Black's erasure move. Against White 1, ... ]

C[After Black jumps to 8, ... ]
;W[lg]
C[... White can also jump to 9. Black's position is not good. However, the moves in the Correct Answer are much clearer. <= ]
