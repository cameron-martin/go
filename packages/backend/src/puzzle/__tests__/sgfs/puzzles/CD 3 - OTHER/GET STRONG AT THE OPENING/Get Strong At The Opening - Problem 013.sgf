C[Correct Answer.  

White should pincer Black's stones with 1 to make them heavy. ]

C[If Black escapes into the center with 2, ... ]

C[Failure.  

White 1 is a good move because it erases the influence of Black's sanren-sei. However, it is bigger to attack the black stones on the upper left side. ]

C[Black has now played the important moves of 2 and the marked stone on the right side. <= ]
