C[Problem 150. White to play.  

Black maps out a huge moyo with 1 and 3. It is now urgent that White reduces the size of this moyo. Where is the weak point of Black's formation ? ]

C[Correct Answer.  

When Black has a tight small-knight enclosure with extensions on both sides, the weak point is White 1. Depending on how Black answers, White will make sabaki by playing at A of B. <= ]

White plays 1 when she wants to erase the top. ]

C[The worst move.  

Invading with 1 gibes Black a target to attack. ]

C[An iron rule.  

Locally, White 1 is a good move, but ... ]

C[... Black then eliminates the weak point of his moyo by jumping to 2. When dealing with a moyo, the iron rule is 'Never let your opponent perfect his moyo.' <= ]
